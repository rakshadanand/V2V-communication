# V2V Communication using LiFi

This repo contains my project on LiFi based vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication.

## Contents
- `arduino_code/` : transmitter and reciever code
- `cpp_simulation/` : small cpp file to test noise effect
- `hardware/` : schematic (basic) and component list
- `docs/` : future scope + pdf report

## How it works
- When brake pressed, led blinks (tx)
- Other car ldr detects it, buzzer sounds (rx)
- Very simple logic, needs lot of improvement

## note
This is student project, not final product.
